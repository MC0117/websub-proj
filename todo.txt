todo before handin

improvements if I could manage the client:
- filter subscribers by topic when publishing, rn it just blasts to everyone
- unsubscribe support (hub.mode=unsubscribe), add a Remove() to the store


- could use context for outbound requests so they cancel if the original req drops

nice to have 
- tests.. at least for the handlers, httptest would work
- improve logging
- graceful shutdown on sigterm
- rate limiting on publish endpoint
- maybe swap the map store for something persistent eventually, redis or sqlite idk
