todo before handin

bugs
- subscribe handler accesses resp before checking err, will nil pointer panic if the GET fails
- need to validate form fields arent empty before using them (callback, topic etc)
- outbound.go ignores error from http.NewRequest, bad url = nil req = crash
- remove the debug printfs before shipping lol

improvements
- filter subscribers by topic when publishing, rn it just blasts to everyone
- IMPORTANT: add timeout to http client in outbound, something like 10s so a dead subscriber doesnt hang forever
- maybe use log instead of fmt.Printf everywhere, more consistent + timestamps
- unsubscribe support (hub.mode=unsubscribe), add a Remove() to the store
- could use context for outbound requests so they cancel if the original req drops

nice to have 
- tests.. at least for the handlers, httptest would work
- improve logging
- graceful shutdown on sigterm
- rate limiting on publish endpoint
- maybe swap the map store for something persistent eventually, redis or sqlite idk
