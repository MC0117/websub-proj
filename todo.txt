todo before handin

improvements if I could manage the client (which I cant):
- filter subscribers by topic when publishing, rn it just blasts to everyone
- unsubscribe support (hub.mode=unsubscribe), add a Remove() to the store

Things for the overengineered branch:
- tests
- rate limiting
- maybe swap the map store for something persistent eventually, redis or sqlite idk


nice to have 
- tests.. at least for the handlers, httptest would work
- improve logging
- graceful shutdown on sigterm
- rate limiting on publish endpoint
